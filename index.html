        <p>I am a free bird that no one can clearly define Within this frame, this space or in a single line A budding engineer - passionate about design Rooting for sustainability my motto I underline Yet there is so much more within me I confine As you unfold this website you'll see me refine To the state of Uttarakhand - by birth I belong Being a defence kid - with patriotism I throng My likes and dislikes are mine - very very strong I love mountaineering, hikes and walks too long  By choice, environmentalist I've been life long To be a minimalist has been my life's true song</p>

          <p>Creating awareness - about strewn garbage In the people who belong to this modern age We made an APP - to show bins on the map The App was a result of our design project This topic for us we were so pleased to select To initiate everyone to get into this noble act For the environment, to make people react Incentives were designed and made on offer Reward points, energy fuel & fitness tracker This App could lure and very easily  motivate As environmental awareness it would create As people collected the waste on their route Duties towards our surroundings it did shoot The people gain fuel with FUGO on their go Cleanliness and sanitation they learn  to show</p>
